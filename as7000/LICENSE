This firmware image is covered under Rebble's authorization to redistribute
modified Pebble firmware images (this firmware image is derived from a
Pebble firmware).  However, it is not necessarily the case that downstream
users have permission to redistribute these images.  If you do wish to build
a firmware image for hardware that uses this binary, you probably should do
your own research to determine whether you are authorized to redistribute
it.
